# 🐢 Day 23 – Turtle Crossing Game (100 Days of Code)

A fun arcade-style game built using Python's `turtle` module — inspired by the classic *Frogger*!  
Your mission? Help the turtle cross the road while dodging speeding cars. Each level gets faster... and harder. 💥

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Creating dynamic objects using classes
- Object collision detection with Turtle graphics
- Managing game speed and difficulty scaling
- Working with event listeners and screen updates

## 🎮 How to Play
- Run the game with Python
- Press the **Up Arrow** key ⬆️ to move the turtle forward
- Avoid the cars!
- Reach the top to level up — each level increases car speed

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 🐍
- Turtle graphics module

## 📁 Project Structure
├── player.py

├── scoreboard.py
├── main.py


## ✅ Features
- Simple keyboard control
- Collision detection
- Score/Level tracking
- Increasing difficulty
- Game over screen
